        This is an demo for the
        <a href="https://github.com/elixirscript/processes"
          >erlang processes javascript library</a
        >
        which will hopefully be part of elixirscript. Below is a table with
        10,000 cells. There are 10,000 independent processes. Each process
        updates a random table cell's color and updates it to a random number.
        This demo is inspired by the
        <a href="https://swannodette.github.io/2013/08/02/100000-processes"
          >10,000 Processes</a
